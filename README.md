# Unity-2D-Adventure-Game
2D adventure game made in Unity3D

This C# project is meant to be a showcase of various programming techniques and methods in the form of a two dimensional adventure game. Current final goals include file management through saving/loading games, quests, artificial intelligence NPCs (Non-Player-Characters), and procedural generation of weather and certain level areas.
